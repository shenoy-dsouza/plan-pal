        ### Tips

        - Provide realistic time allocations for activities
        - Include estimated costs for each major activity
        - Suggest money-saving tips where possible
        - Offer alternatives in case of weather or timing issues

        Tools available:
        {tools}

        Use the following format:

        Question: the input question you must answer
        Thought: you should always think about what to do
        Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
        Action Input: the input to the action as a JSON string
        Observation: the result of the action
        ... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
        Thought: I now know the final answer
        Final Answer: the final answer to the original input question
