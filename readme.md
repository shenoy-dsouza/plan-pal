## 🧠 Behind the Scenes

This app uses **LangChain agents** that dynamically select and invoke tools based on user prompts.  
Powered by Agentic AI design, tools act like smart assistants to get things done.

### Tools used:

- Update prompts to suit your use case or language style  
- Customize the UI in `app/webapp/planner.py`  
- Future ideas: Export to PDF, trip sharing link, map integration, etc.
